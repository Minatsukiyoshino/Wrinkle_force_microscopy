# Wrinkle_force_microscopy
## For the review of Article "Wrinkle force microscopy: a new machine learningbased approach to predict cell mechanics from images".
## A Graphic card with 6GB VRAM is needed.
## Environment:
      with Python 3.5 and CUDA 9.0:
        Tensorflow 1.13.0rc2,
        numpy 1.16.4,
        matplotlib 3.0.2,
        opencv-python 4.1.0.25
## unzip data.zip will acquire training data.
    The data is divided into 2 parts, set the trigger '--dataset' in test.py to train it.
## The value of the force and the visualization of it can be acquired at the same time by running test.py.
